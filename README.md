# Credit-Card-Routing-for-Online-Purchase-via-Predictive-Modelling
Case description:
This is your first day as a data scientist at one of the world’s largest retail companies. Already on your first day, 
you are invited to a meeting with important business stakeholders from the online payment department, who ask 
for your help: Over the past year they have encountered a high failure rate of online credit card payments. The 
company loses a lot of money due to failed transactions and customers become increasingly unsatisfied with the 
online shop. Such online credit card payments are performed via so-called payment service providers, referred to as “PSPs” 
by the business stakeholders. Your company has contracts with four different PSPs and pays transaction fees for 
every single payment. 
The current routing logic is manual and rule-based. Business decision-makers, however, hope that with predictive 
modelling and with your help, a smarter way of routing a PSP to a transaction is possible. 


Project Aim:
Help the business to automate the credit card routing via a predictive model. Such a model should increase the 
payment success rate by finding the best possible PSP for each transaction and at the same time keep the 
transaction fees low.
